<p>I trying to build a console task tracker application 
that will accurately track a worker activity
 on the machine and as well calculate clocking time</p>
corrently with any gitch

<p><em>please understand this solution are strictly built and texted on linux platform</em></p>
<p>First you need to run install python3-evdev by running <em>sudo apt-get install python3-evdev</em> for the programm to work
<br /> where python3-evdev is needed for the keyboard and mouse events
</p>

<p>To run an of the feature cd into the folder eg.
<br /> <em>cd keyboard_mouse</em>
<br /> <em>chmod u+rwx ./start</em>
<br /> <em>./start</em>
</p>
